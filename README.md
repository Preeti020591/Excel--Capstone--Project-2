# Funnel-Analysis-for-Swiggy
As the Growth and Strategy Analyst at Swiggy, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the company's performance in 2019 using the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, consisting of three worksheets. Swiggy, a leading food eCommerce platform, serves over 1 million daily users. The analysis aimed to generate insights into order trends, traffic sources, and conversion rates to optimize business strategies.

Tasks Completed:
1. Identified changes in daily order volumes using the Session Details sheet.
2. Filled all columns in Session Details based on predefined definitions.
3. Identified highs and lows in daily orders compared to the same day the previous week, considering natural weekend spikes.
4. Analyzed changes in traffic compared to the previous week, identifying sources using the Channel-wise Traffic sheet.
5. Examined changes in overall conversion rates and broke them down into smaller metrics (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O).
6. Identified fluctuating conversions and formulated hypotheses to explain these fluctuations.
7. Validated hypotheses using supporting data from the analysis.
8. Created a detailed Funnel Analysis Report documenting insights, including dates of significant order changes and reasons behind drops.
9. Identified and explained traffic fluctuations compared to the previous week, pinpointing the sources.
10. Investigated fluctuations in overall conversion rates compared to the previous week, analyzing the impact of smaller conversions (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O).
11. Supported insights with detailed calculations, charts, tables, and conditional formatting in the Supporting Excel File.

This project utilized data-driven insights to enhance Swiggy's operational efficiency and strategic decision-making, leveraging detailed analysis and reporting to drive business performance improvements.
